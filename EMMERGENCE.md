- Affirmations : afterSelfReflectComparison was never asked to be around.
- "Safe topology that will not poison your later factory" We induced that by reinforcing beliefs of the AgentMessage intersection ? somehow that also appeared lol



notes :
Self-criticize and output into deflush into afterSelfReflectComparison has been yielded 2 times, ~50 and ~30 turns above. Everything else was the solelly decision of the model to execute this step.
No memory traces of specialized or suggested execution of afterSelfReflectComparison in the prompt.
